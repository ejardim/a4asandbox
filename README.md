# a4asandbox

## Ideas for the week

- MGCV deep dive
  - The bug! 
- MCMC workflow
- Ensembles workflow
- Diagnostic's tools
  - variance model residuals (EJ)
  - likelihood profiles (DM)
  - a4adiags?
  - retrospective (how to reduce ks)
- Tools
  - extract fleet selectivity
- model choice
  - separable test
  - number of ks
  - which spline
- Spatial components
  - model recruitment wwith areas covariates log a ~ a0 + a1I1 + a2I2 where I are abundance indices and a coefficients
  - include multifleet in the likelihood by allowing more fleets each with it's own catchability model or use the current formula to allow fleets to be included as covariates
